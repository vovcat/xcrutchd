xcrutchd v0.1 - Beep and sleep X11 helper daemon 

Copyright 2011-2012 by Vladimir Prodan

This daemon perform two functions:

- beeps ALSA device upon receiving XkbBellNotifyEvent

- calls user-defined script and mutes beeps on ScreenSaverOff ->
ScreenSaverOn and backward transition upon receiving XScreenSaverNotifyEvent

First thing the pulseaudio can do, but on my computers even latest as of
Jan 2012 version crashes every 1-7 minutes with SIGBUS like so:

or so:

Just google for 'pulseaudio "Failed to handle SIGBUS"' and see there's no
solution, only links to http://pulseaudio.org/wiki/BrokenSoundDrivers
and http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=593664

Built-in restart doesn't help when you are looking long YouTube video or
recording from webcam. At the same time ALSA software mixer works great,
but doesn't beep:) No way I can use this piece of pottering. So making
my own X11 crutches...
